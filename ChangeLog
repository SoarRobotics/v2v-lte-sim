LTEV2Vsim - Releases Changelog

v5.0
Main modification: common "main" for both LTE-V2X and IEEE 802.11p.
Code has been reorganized and refactored. Other modifications are described in the ReadMe document released with the simulator.
This version has been tested with LTE-V2X Mode 4 and IEEE 802.11p.
Some LTE-V2X Mode 3 algorithms are also derived from previous versions, but they have not been tested in version 5.0.

v.4.1 (previously released as a beta version, it is not available for download)
Main modification: the time granularity of LTE-V2X changes from beacon period to subframe.
Algorithm 18 implements Mode 4 with the new time granularity.

v3.5b
A brief tutorial is available with this version.
Includes both LTE-V2X and IEEE 802.11p.
The time granularity of LTE-V2X is the beacon period.
Both Mode 4 and a few Mode 4 algorithms are implemented, including:
1) NETWORK CONTROLLED with resources chosen in order or randomly
2) NETWORK CONTROLLED with scheduled resource reassignment
3) AUTONOMOUS with simplified sensing (using a given SENSING RANGE)
4) AUTONOMOUS with MAP-RP (i.e., PIMRC 2017 Paper)
5) AUTONOMOUS with sensing algorithm by Qualcomm Inc.
6) AUTONOMOUS with sensing algorithm by Intel Corp.
8) AUTONOMOUS with sensing by 3GPP Mode 4 (Standard)
101) Random allocation
102) NETWORK CONTROLLED with allocation following X coordinate of vehicles
